Libraries Being Used
1)N3.Js (For converting nodes data into RDF)
2)D3 Library (For the creation of Nodes)

Required Interface
1)Browserify to see nodes creation on browser.

Important Instructoins
1) You can run the script directly through localhost by hitting the test.html file.
2)Graphs.js is the main functional file which contains functionality of nodes creation and rdf conversion.
In order to see the effect of changes you made in graphs.js file, just compile this file with N3.js by using the above command
browserify N3.js js/graphs.js -o bundle.js. Please note that you need to run this command in terminal and you should be in
gui folder.


Progress UpTill Now

1) We can create visual nodes on interface.
2) We can link those nodes and can also change their name and type from the side menue, which will appear after clicking on any node.
3) We can also edit the name and type of node.
4) When the data is saved, it is converted into RDF form showing predicate,object and subject.
5) User can also view the help menue on how to create the nodes from the help button in menue bar.
6) A sample Gui is also made for operators detail section.
 

What is required further

The data of nodes is being converted in to RDF form. Now we need to convert this RDF data into triples and should export it
in file. Kindly look into N3 library which is currently being used. There might be some functionality in it to achieve this 
requirement.
