<p>Here you will find a comprehensive list of the enrichment operators included in DEER, their degree bounds, parameters and modes of operation.
If not specified otherwise, they need to have exactly one input and exactly one output dataset.</p>
<h2 id="filter">Filter Enrichment Operator </h2>
<p>The idea of the filter <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#enrichment-operator" class="glossary-term" title="An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
is called enrichment operator.
We call enrichment operators that take and return exactly one dataset  normal enrichment operators, while
those accepting or emitting many datasets are called  hub enrichment operators. ">enrichment operator</a> is to select a specific set of the input dataset triples.
Then, the selected set of triples are generated by the filter operator as its output.
The filter <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#enrichment-operator" class="glossary-term" title="An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
is called enrichment operator.
We call enrichment operators that take and return exactly one dataset  normal enrichment operators, while
those accepting or emitting many datasets are called  hub enrichment operators. ">enrichment operator</a> define the set of triple to be selected using either the single parameter <code>:sparqlConstrucyQuery</code> or <code>:selectors</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>:sparqlConstructQuery</code> takes precedence over <code>:selectors</code> and will accept a string literal that must be a valid SPARQL CONSTRUCT query,
which will then be applied to the input dataset in order to get the output.
This is most useful for manually composing complex filtering rules.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, the <code>:selectors</code> parameter accepts a list of selector types.
By selector we mean the triple patterns to be applied to the input dataset.
The filter <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#enrichment-operator" class="glossary-term" title="An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
is called enrichment operator.
We call enrichment operators that take and return exactly one dataset  normal enrichment operators, while
those accepting or emitting many datasets are called  hub enrichment operators. ">enrichment operator</a> has three basic selectors types. i.e. the <code>:subject</code>, <code>:predicate</code> and <code>:object</code> selectors that can be combined as required.
For simple filtering tasks, e.g. if the task is to filter out everything but triples containing a
few given properties, this is easier to set up than to write a SPARQL query. </p>
<p>The following example configuration demonstrates the configuration of the filter <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#enrichment-operator" class="glossary-term" title="An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
is called enrichment operator.
We call enrichment operators that take and return exactly one dataset  normal enrichment operators, while
those accepting or emitting many datasets are called  hub enrichment operators. ">enrichment operator</a> for filtering only the predicates  <code>geo:lat</code>, <code>geo:long</code>, <code>rdfs:label</code> and <code>owl:sameAs</code>. </p>

<h2 id="linking">Linking Enrichment Operator </h2>
<p>The idea of the linking <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#enrichment-operator" class="glossary-term" title="An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
is called enrichment operator.
We call enrichment operators that take and return exactly one dataset  normal enrichment operators, while
those accepting or emitting many datasets are called  hub enrichment operators. ">enrichment operator</a> is to enrich models with links discovered using LIMES. 
It can be used in two modes:</p>
<ol>
<li>enriching a dataset with links from an external linking process (1 input, 1-2 outputs)  <ul>
<li>This mode will be selected if the linking <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#enrichment-operator" class="glossary-term" title="An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
is called enrichment operator.
We call enrichment operators that take and return exactly one dataset  normal enrichment operators, while
those accepting or emitting many datasets are called  hub enrichment operators. ">enrichment operator</a> node has exactly one input dataset.  </li>
<li>If it has exactly one output dataset, it will be the original input dataset enriched with the links.  </li>
<li>If it has exactly two output datasets, the first will be just the original input dataset and the second will be a dataset of just the generated links.</li>
<li>In this mode, the following parameters are accepted:<ul>
<li><code>:specFile</code> which is a path for LIMES specification file</li>
<li><code>:linksPart</code> one of <code>&quot;source&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;target&quot;</code>. If <code>&quot;source&quot;</code> is selected <em>(default)</em>, nothing happens. If <code>&quot;target&quot;</code> is selected, we swap subjects and objects in the generated links. </li>
<li><code>:selectMode</code> determines the strategy for selecting which links to keep from the original full limes mapping<ul>
<li><code>&quot;all&quot;</code> <em>(default)</em> all links are kept </li>
<li><code>&quot;best1toN&quot;</code> enforces 1-to-N mapping. For each target resource, only keep the best link to the source. </li>
<li><code>&quot;best1to1&quot;</code> enforces 1-to-1 mapping. No resource in either target or source dataset will appear in more than one link.</li>
<li><code>&quot;best&quot;</code> keep just the best link. If there are ties, it is unspecified which will be selected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>enriching a dataset with links from an internal linking process (2 inputs, 1-3 outputs)<ul>

<li>If it has exactly one output dataset, it will be the result of merging the two input datasets and the generated links  </li>
<li>If it has exactly two output datasets, they will correspond to the two input datasets in order and depending on the parameter <code>:linksPart</code>, either the first or the second will be enriched with the generated links.</li>
<li>If it has exactly three output datasets, they will correspond to the two input datasets in order and the third one will be a dataset of just the generated links.</li>
<li>In this mode, the following parameters are accepted:<ul>
<li><code>:linksPart</code> one of <code>&quot;source&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;target&quot;</code>. If <code>&quot;source&quot;</code> is selected <em>(default)</em>, nothing happens. If <code>&quot;target&quot;</code> is selected, we swap subjects and objects in the generated links.<br>Moreover, if the number of output datasets is exactly two, this parameter will decide which of the two datasets will be enriched with the generated links. If it is &quot;source&quot; it will be the first, if it is &quot;target&quot; it will be the second.      </li>

<h2 id="ner">NER Enrichment Operator </h2>
<p>The enrichment information hidden in datatype properties is retrieved by using Named Entity Recognition (NER) <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#enrichment-operator" class="glossary-term" title="An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
is called enrichment operator.
We call enrichment operators that take and return exactly one dataset  normal enrichment operators, while
those accepting or emitting many datasets are called  hub enrichment operators. ">enrichment operator</a>.
In the current version of DEER, we rely on the FOX framework. In the following, we provides details about the NER operator parameters:</p>
<pre><code>- `:literalProperty` Literal property used by FOX for NER. If not set, the top ranked literal property will be pecked automatically by DEER, which ranks the lateral properties of a model according to the average size of each literal property divided by the number of instances of such property.
- `:importProperty` Property added to be added into the input dataset.
- `:neType` Force FOX to look for a specific NE&#x2019;s types only. Available types are: `:location` (default value), `:person:`, `:organization`, and `:all` to retrieve the all the previous three types.
- `:askEndpoint` Ask the DBpedia endpoint for each location returned by FOX (setting it generates slower execution time but more accurate results). By default this parameter is set to false.

<p>The idea behind the clone operator is to enable parallel enrichment of multiple copies of the same dataset. The clone operator takes one dataset as input and produces n &#x2265; 2 output datasets, which are all identical to the input dataset. </p>
<p>In the following example, the clone operator is used to make 2 copies of the input dataset from <code>:node_1</code> into <code>:node_1_clone_1</code> and <code>:node_1_clone_2</code></p>
