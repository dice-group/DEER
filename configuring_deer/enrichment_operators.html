">enrichment operator</a> is to deference all links from an externally linked dataset to our input dataset by using a content negotiation on HTTP.

In addition to the common parameters, the dereferencing operator uses the  parameter <code>operations</code>, which is a list of the following configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:lookUpPrefix</code> interesting resources from the external dataset</li>

<h1 id="ner-enrichment-operator">NER Enrichment Operator</h1>
<p>The enrichment information hidden in datatype properties is retrieved by using Named Entity Recognition (NER) <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#enrichment-operator" class="glossary-term" title="An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
is called enrichment operator.
We call enrichment operators that take and return exactly one dataset  normal enrichment operators, while
those accepting or emitting many datasets are called  hub enrichment operators. ">enrichment operator</a>.
In the current version of DEER, we rely on the FOX framework. In the following, we provides details about the NER operator parameters:</p>
<pre><code>- `:literalProperty` Literal property used by FOX for NER. If not set, the top ranked literal property will be pecked automatically by DEER, which ranks the lateral properties of a model according to the average size of each literal property divided by the number of instances of such property.
- `:importProperty` Property added to be added into the input dataset.
- `:neType` Force FOX to look for a specific NE&#x2019;s types only. Available types are: `:location` (default value), `:person:`, `:organization`, and `:all` to retrieve the all the previous three types.
- `:askEndpoint` Ask the DBpedia endpoint for each location returned by FOX (setting it generates slower execution time but more accurate results). By default this parameter is set to false.

<p>The idea behind the clone operator is to enable parallel enrichment of multiple copies of the same dataset. The clone operator takes one dataset as input and produces n &#x2265; 2 output datasets, which are all identical to the input dataset. </p>

In addtion to the common parameters, the geo-fusion operator have the following additional parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>:fusionAction</code> is used to specify the how to fuse geo-spatial properties (by default the <code>geo:lat</code> and <code>geo:long</code>), the available fusion actions are:<ul>

<li>&quot;takeB&quot; always use geometry from second dataset</li>
<li>&quot;takeAll&quot; merge all geometries&lt;/li&gt;</li>
<li>&quot;takeMostDetailed&quot; use most detailed geometry from any model, e.g., in terms of lexical length of latitude and longitude values<ul>

<p>In the following example, we use the <code>:sourceSubjectAuthority</code> of <code>http://dbpedia.org</code> and the <code>:targetSubjectAuthority</code> of <code>http://deer.org</code>.

<p>The idea of the predicate conformation operator is to replace all instances of specified source property to a specified target predicated with the same object and subject values. In addition to the common parameters, the predicate conformation <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#enrichment-operator" class="glossary-term" title="An operator which takes at least one dataset as input and returns at least one enriched version as output
