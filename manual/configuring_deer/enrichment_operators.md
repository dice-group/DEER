# Enrichment Operator Common Parameters

All our enrichment operators accept a set of one or more input dataset(s) and generate a set of one or more output dataset(s). For configure the input dataset(s) for an enrichment operator, use the `:hasInput` parameter which accepts a list of enrichment nodes. Using the same method, use the `:hasOutput` for specifying the output dataset(s). Finally, we use the `:implementedIn` parameter for specifying the name of the Java class, which implement the current enrichment operator. 

For an example, see the configuration of the filter enrichment operator in the next section, where the `:node_geofusion` is used as a single input dataset and the `:node_writer` is used as the single output dataset.

# Filter Enrichment Operator

The idea of the filter enrichment operator is to select a specific set of the input dataset triples. Then, the selected set of  triples are generated by the filter operator as its output. The filter enrichment operator define the set of triple to be selected using the single parameter `:selectors`. Where the `:selectors` parameter accepts one list of selector types. By selector we mean the triple patterns to be applied to the input dataset. The filter enrichment operator has three basic selectors types. i.e. the `:subject`, `:predicate` and `:object` selectors.


The following example configuration demonstrates the configuration of the filter enrichment operator for filtering only the predicates  `geo:lat`, `geo:long`, `rdfs:label` and `owl:sameAs`.

                    [ :predicate geo:long ]
                    [ :predicate rdfs:label ]
                    [ :predicate owl:sameAs ]
              ) .
```

# Linking Enrichment Operator

The idea of the linking enrichment operator is to enrich models with links discovered using LIMES. 
In addition to the common parameters, the linking enrchment operator accepts the two more parameters of:
  - `:specFile` which is a path for LIMES specification file
  - `:linksPart` which is determine which of the "source" or "target" dataset to be enriched, i.e. which dataset to be the source of the discovered links
  
In the following example, the linking enrichment operator is used based on the LIMES configuration file "limes_specs.xml" and the source dataset is the one to be enriched.
  
  ```turtle
@prefix : <http://deer.aksw.org/vocabulary/#> .

:node_linking
              :implementedIn     :LinkingEnrichmentOperator ;
              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;
              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;
              :specFile          "limes_specs.xml" ;
              :linksPart         "source" .
```

# Dereferencing Enrichment Operator

For datasets which contain similarity properties links (e.g. `owl:sameAs`), the idea dereferencing enrichment operator is to deference all links from an externally linked dataset to our input dataset by using a content negotiation on HTTP. This process returns a set of triples that need to be filtered for relevant information. In addition to the common parameters, the dereferencing operator uses the  parameter `operations`, which is a list of the following configurations:
  - `:lookUpPrefix` interesting resources from the external dataset
  - `:dereferencingProperty` interesting property to extract from the external dataset 
  - `importProperty` for renaming of the `:dereferencingProperty` in the output dataset
  
In the following example, the dereferencing enrichment operator is used to find `dbo:abstract` from external dataset of DBpedia and export them using the `dcterms:description`.

  ```turtle
 @prefix : <http://deer.aksw.org/vocabulary/#> .
 @prefix dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/property/> .
 @prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
  
:dereferencing_dbp
              :implementedIn    :DereferencingEnrichmentOperator ;
              :hasInput         ( :node_in ) ;
              :hasOutput        ( :node_out ) ;
              :operations       (
                    [ :lookUpPrefix "http://de.dbpedia.org/resource" ;
                      :dereferencingProperty dbo:abstract ;
                      :importProperty dcterms:description ]
              ) .
```

# NER Enrichment Operator


The enrichment information hidden in datatype properties is retrieved by using Named Entity Recognition (NER) enrichment operator.
In the current version of DEER, we rely on the FOX framework. In the following, we provides details about the NER operator parameters:
	- `:literalProperty` Literal property used by FOX for NER. If not set, the top ranked literal property will be pecked automatically by DEER, which ranks the lateral properties of a model according to the average size of each literal property divided by the number of instances of such property.
	- `:importProperty` Property added to be added into the input dataset.
	- `:neType` Force FOX to look for a specific NE’s types only. Available types are: `:location` (default value), `:person:`, `:organization`, and `:all` to retrieve the all the previous three types.
	- `:askEndpoint` Ask the DBpedia endpoint for each location returned by FOX (setting it generates slower execution time but more accurate results). By default this parameter is set to false.

# Clone Enrichment Operator

The idea behind the clone operator is to enable parallel enrichment of multiple copies of the same dataset. The clone operator takes one dataset as input and produces n ≥ 2 output datasets, which are all identical to the input dataset. 

In the following example, the clone operator is used to make 2 copies of the input dataset from `:node_1` into `:node_1_clone_1` and `:node_1_clone_2`

  ```turtle
@prefix : <http://deer.aksw.org/vocabulary/#> .

:node_clone
              :implementedIn     :CloneEnrichmentOperator 
              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;
              :hasOutput         ( :node_in_clone_1  :node_in_clone_2) .
```

# Merge Enrichment Operator

The idea behind the merge operator is to enable combining datasets. The merge operator takes a set of n ≥ 2 input datasets and merges them into one output dataset containing all the input datasets’ triples. 

In the following example, the merge operator is used to combine the 2 input datasets of `:node_1` and `:node_2` into `:node_3`


  ```turtle
@prefix : <http://deer.aksw.org/vocabulary/#> .

:node_merge
              :implementedIn     :MergeEnrichmentOperator ;
              :hasInput          ( :node_in_1 :node_in_2) ;
              :hasOutput         ( :node_out) .
```

# GeoFusion Enrichment Operator

The idea of the geo-fusion enrichment operator is to merge two or more input datasets into one fused output dataset.
In addtion to the common parameters, the geo-fusion operator have the following additional parameter:
- The `:fusionAction` is used to specify the how to fuse geo-spatial properties (by default the `geo:lat` and `geo:long`), the available fusion actions are:
    * "takeA" always use geometry from first dataset
    * "takeB" always use geometry from second dataset
    * "takeAll" merge all geometries</li>
    * "takeMostDetailed" use most detailed geometry from any model, e.g., in terms of lexical length of latitude and longitude values
 - The `:mergeOtherStatements` parameter is used to enable the merge of all other non geo-spacial properties from all input dataset to the output dataset

              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;
              :fusionAction      "takeAll" ;
              :mergeOtherStatements
                                 "true" .

# Authority Conformation Enrichment Operator

The idea of the authority conformation operator is to change a specified source URI authority to a specified target URI authority. In addition to the common parameters, the authority conformation enrichment operator accepts the two basic parameters of `:sourceSubjectAuthority` and `:targetSubjectAuthority` for specifying the source and target authorities respectively. 

In the following example, we use the `:sourceSubjectAuthority` of `http://dbpedia.org` and the `:targetSubjectAuthority` of `http://deer.org`. Such configuration will change a resource like `http://dbpedia.org/Berlin` to `http://deer.org/Berlin`.

              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;
              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;
              :sourceSubjectAuthority
                                 "http://dbpedia.org" ;
              :targetSubjectAuthority
                                 "http://deer.org" .
```

# Predicate Conformation Enrichment Operator

The idea of the predicate conformation operator is to replace all instances of specified source property to a specified target predicated with the same object and subject values. In addition to the common parameters, the predicate conformation enrichment operator accepts the basic parameters of `:propertyMapping` for specifying the `:source` and `:target` predicates as a list. 

In the following example, we use the predicate conformation enrichment operator to change all instances of `rdf:label` to `SKOS:prefLabel`. For example, a triple as  `dbp:Berlin rdf:label "Berlin"` to `dbp:Berlin skos:prefLabel "Berlin"`.

              :propertyMapping    (
                    [ :source rdf:label ]
                    [ :target skos:prefLabel ]
              ) .
