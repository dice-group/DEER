# Filter Enrichment Operator

The idea of the filter enrichment operator is to select a specific set of the input dataset triples. Then, the selected set of  triples are generated by the filter operator as its output. The filter enrichment operator define the set of triple to be selected using the single parameter `:selectors`. Where the `:selectors` parameter accepts one list of selector types. By selector we mean the triple patterns to be applied to the input dataset. The filter enrichment operator has three basic selectors types. i.e. the `:subject`, `:predicate` and `:object` selectors.


The following example configuration demonstrates how to configure the filter enrichment operator:
