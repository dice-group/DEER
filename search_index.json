has been outsourced to FARADAY-CAGE, a framework that provides\nabstractions for nodes in a directed acyclic graph that represent computation steps on more or\nless homogeneous data structures which are in turn represented by the graphs edges.\nThis kind of graph is called execution graph.\nIt is dynamically built from an RDF specification by use of PF4J's plugin mechanism.\nGraph nodes in FARADAY-CAGE are PF4J extension points, which means that every step in the execution\ngraph is performed by a plugin that is dynamically loaded and automatically parametrized from\nthe RDF configuration.\nFARADAY-CAGE will also automatically parallelize plugins based on the graphs structure.\nDEER itself consists of two modules: deer-core and  deer-cli.\nThe first is a library that implements a domain model for dataset enrichment on top of FARADAY-CAGE\nwhile the latter provides a CLI that can either run a single configuration or spawn a server to \nsubmit tasks over a RESTful API. In a future release, the API will be accompanied by a web app\nto build configurations graphically in the browser.\nDEER Plugin characteristics\nAll DEER plugins implement the Node interface from FARADAY-CAGE.\nAs such, they have so called degree bounds, which restrict the number of datasets they can accept and emit.\nDegree bounds are notated as (minIn, maxIn, minOut, maxOut), where\n\nminIn is the minimum number of accepted datasets\nmaxIn is the maximum number of accepted datasets\nminIn is the minimum number of emitted datasets\nmaxIn is the maximum number of emitted datasets\n\nDEER Plugin Types\nDEERs domain model specifies three basic plugin types:\n\nA ModelReader (0,0,1,1) is the only plugin that can be a root node in the execution graph and likewise it\nmust be a root node. It is responsible for reading one RDF dataset from a dedicated source to feed it into \nthe exxecution graph.  \nA ModelWriter (1,1,0,1) can be an intermediary or a leaf node and it will write one RDF dataset to an external channel,\ne.g. a file or a triplestore.  \nAn EnrichmentOperator (1,N,1,M) is an intermediary node that takes one or more RDF datasets as input,\nexecutes arbitrary transformations on them and outputs the result as one or more RDF datasets.\n\n"},"configuring_deer/":{"url":"configuring_deer/","title":"Configuring DEER","keywords":"","body":"Configuring DEER\nDEER is configured using a simple RDF vocabulary.\nIts namespace is http://w3id.org/deer/.\nThere are just three predefined predicates that DEER inherits from FARADAY-CAGE:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn about the usage of these predicates please read the documentation on the FARADAY-CAGE core vocabulary. \nPlugins are associated with unique resources. The default plugins that ship with deer-core live in\nthe deer namespace and have just their class name as local part, e.g.: \n\n\n\n\n\nCustom plugins should be identified by resources outside of the default namespace to prevent\nnaming collisions.\nPlugins define their own configuration vocabulary.

If \"source\" is selected (default), nothing happens. If \"target\" is selected, we swap subjects and objects in the generated links. \n:selectMode determines the strategy for selecting which links to keep from the original full limes mapping\n\"all\" (default) all links are kept \n\"best1toN\" enforces 1-to-N mapping. For each target resource, only keep the best link to the source. \n\"best1to1\" enforces 1-to-1 mapping.

If \"source\" is selected (default), nothing happens. If \"target\" is selected, we swap subjects and objects in the generated links.Moreover, if the number of output datasets is exactly two, this parameter will decide which of the two datasets will be enriched with the generated links. If it is \"source\" it will be the first, if it is \"target\" it will be the second.      \n:selectMode determines the strategy for selecting which links to keep from the original full limes mapping\n\"all\" (default) all links are kept \n\"best1toN\" enforces 1-to-N mapping. For each target resource, only keep the best link to the source. \n\"best1to1\" enforces 1-to-1 mapping. No resource in either target or source dataset will appear in more than one link.\n\"best\" keep just the best link. If there are ties, it is unspecified which will be selected.\n\n\n:linkSpecification the link specification to execute (as string literal)\n:linkingPredicate the predicate with which links will be built\n:threshold the similarity threshold. All links in the resulted mapping will have a similarity value greater than or equal to the threshold. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following example, the linking enrichment operator is used based on the LIMES configuration file \"limes_specs.xml\" and the source dataset is the one to be enriched.\n@prefix :  .\n\n:node_linking\n              :implementedIn     :LinkingEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :specFile          \"limes_specs.xml\" ;\n              :linksPart         \"source\" .\n\nDereferencing Enrichment Operator \nFor datasets which contain similarity properties links (e.g. owl:sameAs), the idea dereferencing enrichment operator is to deference all links from an externally linked dataset to our input dataset by using a content negotiation on HTTP. This process returns a set of triples that need to be filtered for relevant information. In addition to the common parameters, the dereferencing operator uses the  parameter operations, which is a list of the following configurations:\n\n:lookUpPrefix interesting resources from the external dataset\n:dereferencingProperty interesting property to extract from the external dataset \nimportProperty for renaming of the :dereferencingProperty in the output dataset\n\nIn the following example, the dereferencing enrichment operator is used to find dbo:abstract from external dataset of DBpedia and export them using the dcterms:description.\n @prefix :  .\n @prefix dbo:  .\n @prefix dcterms:  .\n\n:dereferencing_dbp\n              :implementedIn    :DereferencingEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput         ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput        ( :node_out ) ;\n              :operations       (\n                    [ :lookUpPrefix \"http://de.dbpedia.org/resource\" ;\n                      :dereferencingProperty dbo:abstract ;\n                      :importProperty dcterms:description ]\n              ) .\n\nNER Enrichment Operator \nThe enrichment information hidden in datatype properties is retrieved by using Named Entity Recognition (NER) enrichment operator.\nIn the current version of DEER, we rely on the FOX framework. In the following, we provides details about the NER operator parameters:\n- `:literalProperty` Literal property used by FOX for NER. If not set, the top ranked literal property will be pecked automatically by DEER, which ranks the lateral properties of a model according to the average size of each literal property divided by the number of instances of such property.\n- `:importProperty` Property added to be added into the input dataset.\n- `:neType` Force FOX to look for a specific NE’s types only. Available types are: `:location` (default value), `:person:`, `:organization`, and `:all` to retrieve the all the previous three types.\n- `:askEndpoint` Ask the DBpedia endpoint for each location returned by FOX (setting it generates slower execution time but more accurate results). By default this parameter is set to false.\nClone Enrichment Operator \nThe idea behind the clone operator is to enable parallel enrichment of multiple copies of the same dataset. The clone operator takes one dataset as input and produces n ≥ 2 output datasets, which are all identical to the input dataset. \nIn the following example, the clone operator is used to make 2 copies of the input dataset from :node_1 into :node_1_clone_1 and :node_1_clone_2\n@prefix :  .\n\n:node_clone\n              :implementedIn     :CloneEnrichmentOperator \n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_in_clone_1  :node_in_clone_2) .\n\nMerge Enrichment Operator \nThe idea behind the merge operator is to enable combining datasets. The merge operator takes a set of n ≥ 2 input datasets and merges them into one output dataset containing all the input datasets’ triples. \nIn the following example, the merge operator is used to combine the 2 input datasets of :node_1 and :node_2 into :node_3\n@prefix :  .\n\n:node_merge\n              :implementedIn     :MergeEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in_1 :node_in_2) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out) .\n\nGeoFusion Enrichment Operator \nThe idea of the geo-fusion enrichment operator is to merge two or more input datasets into one fused output dataset.\nIn addtion to the common parameters, the geo-fusion operator have the following additional parameter:\n\nThe :fusionAction is used to specify the how to fuse geo-spatial properties (by default the geo:lat and geo:long), the available fusion actions are:\n\"takeA\" always use geometry from first dataset\n\"takeB\" always use geometry from second dataset\n\"takeAll\" merge all geometries\n\"takeMostDetailed\" use most detailed geometry from any model, e.g., in terms of lexical length of latitude and longitude values\nThe :mergeOtherStatements parameter is used to enable the merge of all other non geo-spacial properties from all input dataset to the output dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n@prefix :  .\n@prefix rdfs:  .\n@prefix geo:  .\n@prefix owl:  .\n\n:node_geofusion\n              :implementedIn     :GeoFusionEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in_1 :node_in_2 ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :fusionAction      \"takeAll\" ;\n              :mergeOtherStatements\n                                 \"true\" .\n\nAuthority Conformation Enrichment Operator \nThe idea of the authority conformation operator is to change a specified source URI authority to a specified target URI authority. In addition to the common parameters, the authority conformation enrichment operator accepts the two basic parameters of :sourceSubjectAuthority and :targetSubjectAuthority for specifying the source and target authorities respectively. \nIn the following example, we use the :sourceSubjectAuthority of http://dbpedia.org and the :targetSubjectAuthority of http://deer.org. Such configuration will change a resource like http://dbpedia.org/Berlin to http://deer.org/Berlin. \n@prefix :  .\n\n:node_a_conf\n              :implementedIn     :AuthorityConformationEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :sourceSubjectAuthority\n                                 \"http://dbpedia.org\" ;\n              :targetSubjectAuthority\n                                 \"http://deer.org\" .\n\nPredicate Conformation Enrichment Operator \nThe idea of the predicate conformation operator is to replace all instances of specified source property to a specified target predicated with the same object and subject values. In addition to the common parameters, the predicate conformation enrichment operator accepts the basic parameters of :propertyMapping for specifying the :source and :target predicates as a list. \nIn the following example, we use the predicate conformation enrichment operator to change all instances of rdf:label to SKOS:prefLabel. For example, a triple as  dbp:Berlin rdf:label \"Berlin\" to dbp:Berlin skos:prefLabel \"Berlin\". \n@prefix :  .\n@prefix rdf:  .\n@prefix skos:  .\n\n:node_p_conf\n              :implementedIn     :PredicateConformationEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :propertyMapping    (\n                    [ :source rdf:label ]\n                    [ :target skos:prefLabel ]\n              ) .\n\nGeoDistance Enrichment Operator \nThe idea of the geo-distance operator is to enrich resources that are connected via\nsome predicate (configured with parameter :selectPredicate) with the distance between\ntheir respective geo coordinates.\nThe distance in kilometers will be added as a string literal to the subject via the predicate specified\nin parameter :distancePredicate. \nIn the following example, we use the geo-distance enrichment operator to enrich cities from DBPedia\nwith the distance to their western adjacent cities. \n@prefix :  .\n@prefix dbp :  .\n\n:node_geodistance\n              :implementedIn     :GeoDistanceEnrichmentOperator ;\n              :hasInput          ( :node_in ) ;\n              :hasOutput         ( :node_out ) ;\n              :selectPredicate   dbp:west ; \n              :distancePredicate :distanceToNextCityInTheWest .\n\n"},"extending_deer/":{"url":"extending_deer/","title":"Extending DEER","keywords":"","body":"Extending DEER\nDEER is built on top of FARADAY-CAGE, which uses the\nplugin system PF4J.This is good news for developers willing to extend DEER with their custom enrichment operators,\nas you do not need to fork and mess with DEER source directly.\nInstead, you just need to follow a few guidelines and implement an easy interface to be ready to\nplug your enrichment operator into DEER.  \nWe define three base interfaces:\n\norg.aksw.deer.DeerPlugin \norg.aksw.deer.ParametrizedDeerPlugin\norg.aksw.deer.learning.SelfConfigurator\n\nand four abstract classes:\n\norg.aksw.deer.enrichments.AbstractEnrichmentOperator\norg.aksw.deer.enrichments.AbstractParametrizedEnrichmentOperator\norg.aksw.deer.io.AbstractModelReader\norg.aksw.deer.io.AbstractModelWriter\n\nYou should always extend the abstract classes and never need to implement the interfaces directly,\nbut they could come in handy when trying to obtain instances programmatically using \norg.aksw.faraday-cage.PluginFactory.\nFor more information on how to extend these classes, please read the Javadoc.
