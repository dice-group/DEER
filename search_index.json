been outsourced to FARADAY-CAGE, a framework that provides\nabstractions for nodes in a directed acyclic graph that represent computation steps on homogeneous\ndata structures which are in turn represented by the graphs edges.This kind of graph is called execution graph.\nIt is dynamically built from an RDF specification by use of PF4J's plugin mechanism.\nGraph nodes in FARADAY-CAGE are PF4J extension points, which means that every step in the execution\ngraph is performed by a plugin that is dynamically loaded and automatically parametrized from\nthe RDF configuration.\nFARADAY-CAGE will also automatically parallelize plugins based on the graphs structure.To learn more about FARADAY-CAGE, check out its manual! \nDEER itself consists of two modules: deer-core and deer-cli.\nThe first is a library that implements a domain model for dataset enrichment on top of FARADAY-CAGE\nwhile the latter provides a CLI that can either run a single configuration or spawn a server to \nsubmit tasks over a RESTful API. In a future release, the API will be accompanied by a web app\nto build configurations graphically in the browser.\nDEER Plugin Types\nDEERs domain model builds on two utility interfaces which basically are just non-generic reductions\nof the corresponding FARADAY-CAGE interfaces:\n\nDeerExecutionNode extends ExecutionNode\nDeerExecutionNodeWrapper extends ExecutionNodeWrapper\n\nDEER Plugin characteristics\nDEER plugins that implement the DeerExecutionNode interface inherit from the ExecutionNode interface of FARADAY-CAGE.\nTherefore, they have so called degree bounds, which restrict the number of datasets they can accept and emit.\nDegree bounds are notated as (minIn, maxIn, minOut, maxOut), where\n\nminIn is the minimum number of accepted datasets\nmaxIn is the maximum number of accepted datasets\nminIn is the minimum number of emitted datasets\nmaxIn is the maximum number of emitted datasets\n\nThe following three plugin types are derived from DeerExecutionNode. For each of them there\nexists a convenience abstract class which specifies the according degree bounds and other utility methods.\n\nA ModelReader (0,0,1,1) is the only plugin that can be a root node in the execution graph and likewise it\nmust be a root node. It is responsible for reading one RDF dataset from a dedicated source to feed it into \nthe exxecution graph.  \nA ModelWriter (1,1,0,1) can be an intermediary or a leaf node and it will write one RDF dataset to an external channel,\ne.g. a file or a triplestore.  \nAn EnrichmentOperator (1,N,1,M) is an intermediary node that takes one or more RDF datasets as input,\nexecutes arbitrary transformations on them and outputs the result as one or more RDF datasets.\n\n"},"configuring_deer/":{"url":"configuring_deer/","title":"Configuring DEER","keywords":"","body":"Configuring DEER\nDEER

If \"source\" is selected (default),\nnothing happens. If \"target\" is selected, we swap subjects and objects in the generated links. \ndeer:selectMode determines the strategy for selecting which links to keep from the original\nfull limes mapping\n\"all\" (default) all links are kept \n\"best1toN\" enforces 1-to-N mapping. For each target resource, only keep the best link to the source. \n\"best1to1\" enforces 1-to-1 mapping. No resource in either target or source dataset\nwill appear in more than one link.\n\"best\" keep just the best link. If there are ties, it is unspecified which will be selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenriching a dataset with links from an internal linking process (2 inputs, 1-3 outputs)\nThis mode will be selected if the linking enrichment operator node has exactly two input datasets.  \nIf it has exactly one output dataset, it will be the result of merging the two input\ndatasets and the generated links  \nIf it has exactly two output datasets, they will correspond to the two input datasets in\norder and depending on the parameter deer:linksPart, either the first or the second will\nbe enriched with the generated links.\nIf it has exactly three output datasets, they will correspond to the two input datasets\nin order and the third one will be a dataset of just the generated links.\nIn this mode, the following parameters are accepted:\ndeer:linksPart one of \"source\", \"target\". If \"source\" is selected (default),\nnothing happens. If \"target\" is selected, we swap subjects and objects in the generated links.Moreover, if the number of output datasets is exactly two, this parameter will decide\nwhich of the two datasets will be enriched with the generated links. If it is \"source\"\nit will be the first, if it is \"target\" it will be the second.      \ndeer:selectMode determines the strategy for selecting which links to keep from the original full limes mapping\n\"all\" (default) all links are kept \n\"best1toN\" enforces 1-to-N mapping. For each target resource, only keep the best link to the source. \n\"best1to1\" enforces 1-to-1 mapping. No resource in either target or source dataset will appear in more than one link.\n\"best\" keep just the best link. If there are ties, it is unspecified which will be selected.\n\n\ndeer:linkSpecification the link specification to execute (as string literal)\ndeer:linkingPredicate the predicate with which links will be built\ndeer:threshold the similarity threshold. All links in the resulted mapping will have a\nsimilarity value greater than or equal to the threshold. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following example, the linking enrichment operator is used based on the LIMES configuration\nfile \"limes_specs.xml\" and the source dataset is the one to be enriched.\n@prefix :  .\n@prefix deer:  .\n\n:node_linking\n  a deer:LinkingEnrichmentOperator ;\n  deer:specFile \"limes_specs.xml\" ;\n  deer:linksPart \"source\" ;\n.\n\nDereferencing Enrichment Operator (deer:DereferencingEnrichmentOperator) \nFor datasets which contain similarity properties links (e.g. owl:sameAs), the idea of the dereferencing\nenrichment operator is to deference all links from an externally linked dataset to our input dataset\nby using a content negotiation on HTTP.This process returns a set of triples that need to be filtered for relevant information.\nOne dereferencing operation is represented by the deer:operation parameter which takes as object\na resource with the following properties:\n\ndeer:lookUpPrefix interesting resources from the external dataset\ndeer:dereferencingProperty interesting property to extract from the external dataset \ndeer:importProperty for renaming of the deer:dereferencingProperty in the output dataset\n\nOne can specify any number of deer:operation parameters and they will all be carried out and in\ncase of overlapping lookup, they will be carried out together to save bandwidth.In the following example, the dereferencing enrichment operator is used to find dbo:abstract from\nexternal dataset of DBpedia and export them using the dcterms:description.\n@prefix :  .\n@prefix deer:  .\n@prefix dbo:  .\n@prefix dcterms:  .\n\n:dereferencing_dbp\n  a deer:DereferencingEnrichmentOperator ;\n  deer:operation [\n    :lookUpPrefix \"http://de.dbpedia.org/resource\" ;\n    :dereferencingProperty dbo:abstract ;\n    :importProperty dcterms:description ;\n  ] ;\n.\n\nNER Enrichment Operator (deer:NEREnrichmentOperator) \nThe enrichment information hidden in datatype properties is retrieved by using Named Entity\nRecognition (NER) enrichment operator.\nIn the current version of DEER, we rely on the FOX framework. In the following, we provides\ndetails about the NER operator parameters:\n\ndeer:literalProperty Literal property used by FOX for NER. If not set, the top ranked literal\nproperty will be pecked automatically by DEER, which ranks the lateral properties of a model\naccording to the average size of each literal property divided by the number of instances of such property.\ndeer:importProperty Property added to be added into the input dataset.\ndeer:neType Force FOX to look for a specific NE’s types only. Available types are: \"location\" (default value),\n\"person\", \"organization\", and \"all\" to retrieve the all the previous three types.\ndeer:askEndpoint Ask the DBpedia endpoint for each location returned by FOX\n(setting it generates slower execution time but more accurate results).By default this parameter is set to false.\n\nClone Enrichment Operator (deer:CloneEnrichmentOperator) \nThe idea behind the clone operator is to enable parallel enrichment of multiple copies of the\nsame dataset. The clone operator takes one dataset as input and produces n ≥ 2 output datasets,\nwhich are all identical to the input dataset. \nIn the following example, the clone operator is used to make 2 copies of the input dataset from\ndeer:node_1 into deer:clone_1 and deer:clone_2\n@prefix :  .\n@prefix fcage:  .\n@prefix deer:  .\n\n:node_clone\n  a deer:CloneEnrichmentOperator ; \n  fcage:hasInput ( :node_in ) ;\n  fcage:hasOutput ( :clone_1  :clone_2 ) ;\n.\n\nMerge Enrichment Operator (deer:MergeEnrichmentOperator) \nThe idea behind the merge operator is to enable combining datasets.\nThe merge operator takes a set of n ≥ 2 input datasets and merges them into one output dataset\ncontaining all the input datasets’ triples. \nIn the following example, the merge operator is used to combine the 2 input datasets of\ndeer:node_1 and deer:node_2 into deer:node_3\n@prefix :  .\n@prefix fcage:  .\n@prefix deer:  .\n\n:node_merge\n  a deer:MergeEnrichmentOperator ;\n  fcage:hasInput ( :node_in_1 :node_in_2 ) ;\n  fcage:hasOutput ( :node_out ) ;\n.\n\nGeoFusion Enrichment Operator (deer:GeoFusionEnrichmentOperator) \nThe idea of the geo-fusion enrichment operator is to merge two or more input datasets into one\nfused output dataset.\nIn addtion to the common parameters, the geo-fusion operator have the following additional parameter:\n\nThe deer:fusionAction is used to specify the how to fuse geo-spatial properties\n(by default the geo:lat and geo:long), the available fusion actions are:\n\"takeA\" always use geometry from first dataset\n\"takeB\" always use geometry from second dataset\n\"takeAll\" merge all geometries\n\"takeMostDetailed\" use most detailed geometry from any model, e.g., in terms of lexical\nlength of latitude and longitude values\nThe deer:mergeOtherStatements parameter is used to enable the merge of all other non geo-spacial\nproperties from all input dataset to the output dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n@prefix :  .\n@prefix fcage:  .\n@prefix deer:  .\n@prefix rdfs:  .\n@prefix geo:  .\n@prefix owl:  .\n\n:node_geofusion\n  a deer:GeoFusionEnrichmentOperator ;\n  deer:fusionAction \"takeAll\" ;\n  deer:mergeOtherStatements \"true\"^^xsd:boolean ;\n.\n\nAuthority Conformation Enrichment Operator (deer:AuthorityConformationEnrichmentOperator) \nThe idea of the authority conformation operator is to change a specified source URI authority to a\nspecified target URI authority.\nOne authority conformation operation is represented by the deer:operation property.\nThe objects of deer:operation need to be resources with the properties\ndeer:sourceAuthority and deer:targetAuthority for specifying the\nsource and target authorities respectively.\nAny number of authority conformation operations can be specified by declaring multiple deer:operation\nparameters.\nIn the following example, we use the deer:sourceAuthority of http://dbpedia.org and the\ndeer:targetAuthority of http://example.org.\nSuch configuration will change a resource like http://dbpedia.org/Berlin to http://example.org/Berlin. \n@prefix :  .\n@prefix deer:  .\n\n:node_a_conf\n  a deer:AuthorityConformationEnrichmentOperator ;\n  deer:operation [ \n    deer:sourceSubjectAuthority  ;\n    deer:targetSubjectAuthority  .\n  ];\n.\n\nPredicate Conformation Enrichment Operator (deer:PredicateConformationEnrichmentOperator) \nThe idea of the predicate conformation operator is to replace all instances of specified source\nproperty to a specified target predicated with the same object and subject values.\nOne predicate conformation operation is represented by the deer:operation property.\nThe objects of deer:operation need to be resources with the properties\ndeer:sourcePredicate and deer:targetPredicate for specifying the\nsource and target predicates respectively.\nAny number of predicate conformation operations can be specified by declaring multiple deer:operation\nparameters.\nIn the following example, we use the predicate conformation enrichment operator to change all\ninstances of rdf:label to SKOS:prefLabel.\nFor example, a triple as dbp:Berlin rdf:label \"Berlin\" will be changed to \ndbp:Berlin skos:prefLabel \"Berlin\". \n@prefix :  .\n@prefix deer:  .\n@prefix rdf:  .\n@prefix skos:  .\n\n:node_p_conf\n  a deer:PredicateConformationEnrichmentOperator ;\n  deer:operation [\n    deer:sourcePredicate rdf:label ;\n    deer:targetPredicate skos:prefLabel ;\n  ] ;\n.\n\nGeoDistance Enrichment Operator (deer:GeoDistanceEnrichmentOperator) \nThe idea of the geo-distance operator is to enrich resources that are connected via\nsome predicate (configured with parameter deer:selectPredicate) with the distance between\ntheir respective geo coordinates.\nThe distance in kilometers will be added as a string literal to the subject via the predicate specified\nin parameter deer:distancePredicate. \nIn the following example, we use the geo-distance enrichment operator to enrich cities from DBPedia\nwith the distance to their western adjacent cities. \n@prefix :  .\n@prefix deer:  .\n@prefix dbp :  .\n\n:node_geodistance\n  a deer:GeoDistanceEnrichmentOperator ;\n  deer:selectPredicate dbp:west ; \n  deer:distancePredicate :distanceToNextCityInTheWest ;\n.\n\nSPARQL Update Enrichment Operator (deer:SparqlUpdateEnrichmentOperator) \nThe SPARQL Update Enrichment Operator is used to execute a SPARQL UPDATE operation on an input\ndataset.\nIt takes the single parameter deer:sparqlUpdateQuery which must be a valid SPARQL UPDATE query\nand executes it on its only input.\nIn the following example we use the operator to update all given names of \"Bill\" to \"William\". \n@prefix :  .\n@prefix deer:  .\n\n:node_update\n  a deer:SparqlUpdateEnrichmentOperator;\n  deer:sparqlUpdateQuery \"\"\"\n    PREFIX foaf:  \n    DELETE { ?person foaf:givenName 'Bill' }\n    INSERT { ?person foaf:givenName 'William' }\n    WHERE\n      {\n        ?person foaf:givenName 'Bill'\n      }  \n  \"\"\" ;
